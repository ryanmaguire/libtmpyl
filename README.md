# libtmpyl
Python wrapper for libtmpl. After building and installing
[libtmpl](https://github.com/ryanmaguire/libtmpl/), build `tmpyl` via:
```
python3 setup.py install
```
You may need to `sudo` this:
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
You can also use `pip`:
```
pip3 install .
```
For macOS users replace `python3` with `python` and `pip3` with `pip`.

The library also supports Python 2.
```
python2 setup.py install
```
**The setup.py file does not currently work with Windows.**
The fix should be simple enough, but I haven't gotten around to it.
